Improving data integration, quality of multi source analytics.
This project deals with integrating multiple csv files by cleaning and loading from ETL process.
We have used python code that reads the data cleans the data by removing duplicates, cleaning columns and values.
Then it combines our data together and integrates it at a common place. Here all our csv files are merged together which is error free.
The python code which we have used is dynamic so the user can use any dataset to integrate by using this code.
The platform that we have used to view the integrated data is Neon Console.
The working of neol console is :
The Neon console is a web-based interface that provides a user-friendly way to manage your Neon serverless PostgreSQL database. It offers various features to help you create, configure, monitor, and interact with your database. Here's a breakdown of some key aspects:
Key Features and Functionality:
 * Database Management: The console allows you to create new database instances, manage existing ones, and monitor their performance. You can configure settings like compute resources, storage capacity, and security options.
 * Branching: Neon's branching feature is a standout, enabling you to create copies of your database for development, testing, or experimentation without affecting your production data. This promotes safe and efficient workflows.
 * Read Replicas: You can easily create and manage read replicas to scale your database for read-heavy workloads. This improves performance and responsiveness for applications that require extensive data retrieval.
 * Data Exploration: The console often integrates tools or interfaces to explore and manipulate your data directly. This could include a SQL editor or a visual data browser, allowing you to query, update, and manage your data.
 * Monitoring and Analytics: Neon provides monitoring tools within the console to track database performance, resource usage, and other key metrics. This helps you identify potential issues and optimize your database for optimal performance.
 * Security: The console facilitates the management of security settings, including user access control, authentication, and network policies. This ensures that your database is protected from unauthorized access.
Benefits of Using the Neon Console:
 * Ease of Use: The web-based interface makes it easy to manage your Neon database without requiring complex command-line tools or technical expertise.
 * Efficiency: The console streamlines common database tasks, such as creating branches, managing read replicas, and monitoring performance.
 * Collaboration: Depending on the features, the console may support team collaboration by allowing multiple users to access and manage the database with different roles and permissions.
Getting Started with the Neon Console:
To start using the Neon console, you'll typically need to:
 * Sign up for a Neon account: Visit the Neon website and create an account.
 * Create a database instance: Follow the instructions in the console to create a new PostgreSQL database instance.
 * Connect to your database: Use the connection details provided in the console to connect your applications or tools to your Neon database.
Remember that the specific features and functionality of the Neon console might evolve over time, so it's always a good idea to refer to the official Neon documentation for the most up-to-dateÂ information.
